# 2D spiral demo sequence for tv6 (Pulseq on GE v1)

Adapt [writeSpiral.m](https://github.com/pulseq/pulseq/blob/master/matlab/demoSeq/writeSpiral.m)
to work with the tv6 interpreter. 

Original version of writeSpiral.m obtained from the Pulseq master branch,
git commit b172844fba330dcc46d166430818f28aca7d81e0, Dec 19, 2024.

Tested on the following system:
* GE MR750 
* SW version MR30.1_R01
* Pulseq interpreter tv6 [v1.9.1](https://github.com/jfnielsen/TOPPEpsdSourceCode/releases/tag/v1.9.1)

See [main.m](main.m) for steps required to prepare the sequence file and reconstruct.
