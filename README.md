# Pulseq on GE examples

**Updated January 2025**

This repository contains examples of how to prepare and run Pulseq sequences
on GE scanners using the community-developed Pulseq on GE interpreter[^1][^2].

There are three versions of the interpreter available:
* tv6, the 'classic' TOPPE interpreter
* pge2, Pulseq on GE v2
* tv6 with MNS support

If you discover a bug/problem with any of the examples, 
please report it [here](https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI/SequenceExamples-GE/issues).

The 'main' branch contains tested examples.  
The 'develop' branch contains works in progress at various stages of development/testing.

Anyone is welcome to contribute sequence examples to this site.  
If you have a larger or more advanced Pulseq project to share, consider posting it on
https://harmonizedmri.github.io/.
