# Pulseq on GE examples for learning and testing

**Updated January 2025**

This repository contains examples of how to prepare and run Pulseq sequences
on GE scanners using the Pulseq on GE interpreter.

There are two versions of the interpreter available:
* tv6, the 'classic' TOPPE interpreter
* pge2, Pulseq on GE v2

If you discover a bug/problem with any of the examples, 
please report it [here](https://github.com/HarmonizedMRI/SequenceExamples-GE/issues).
