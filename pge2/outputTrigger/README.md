# Demonstrate trigger out (TTL) pulse in Pulseq on GE v2 (pge2)

2D SPGR acquisition with a trigger out pulse placed before readout (ADC) window.

Tested on the following system(s):  
| Scanner | Scanner SW version | pge2 version | PulCeq version |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

To download the required MATLAB packages,
create the pge sequence file, and reconstruct the data, see `main.m` in this folder.
