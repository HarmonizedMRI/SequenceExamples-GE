# Sequence example with 1us dwell time (MAGNUS only)

Under development.  
See https://github.com/jfnielsen/TOPPEpsdSourceCode/discussions/47

To create .seq and .pge file, in MATLAB do:
```matlab
>> main;
```

Jon Nielsen was able to run this
on MR750, using pge2 v2.5.0-beta3
(dwell = 1us; PulCeq 2.4.1 as in main.m)
