# Spiral sequence for Pulseq on GE (tv6 and pge2)

Interleaved 2D spiral.  

Tested on the following system(s):
* GE UHP
* SW version MR30.1_R01
* Pulseq interpreter tv6 v1.9.1, available at https://github.com/jfnielsen/TOPPEpsdSourceCode/releases/tag/v1.9.1

TODO: test with pge2

To download the required MATLAB packages,
create the pge sequence file, and reconstruct the data, see `main.m` in this folder.
